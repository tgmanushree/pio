<h2>NOTE FROM FOUNDER</h2>
<p>Throughout my extensive career, my focus has been on revitalizing marital relationships, empowering individuals on journeys of self-improvement, and strengthening parent-child bonds. I bring a wealth of expertise in evidence-based therapies such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy (REBT), and Mindfulness-Based CBT, tailoring interventions to address negative thought patterns and foster positive behavioral change. Additionally, my proficiency extends to Imago Couple Therapy, enhancing communication skills, and employing strategies from Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) for mindful living. Adept in conflict management, I help individuals and families navigate challenges to build healthier, more fulfilling relationships. With a commitment to maintaining confidentiality and utilizing strong case formulation skills, I create a safe and supportive environment. My passion lies in fostering well-being, promoting positive connections, and making a meaningful impact on the lives of those I serve. Let's connect and embark on a journey towards positive transformation.</p>
